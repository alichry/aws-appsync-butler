# Introduction

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

export const Row = ({ children }) => (
    <div className="container">
        <div className="row">
            {children}
        </div>
    </div>
);

With the power of Apache Velocity, [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) allows for quick deployment of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs. Stored AppSync VTL resolvers require manual instructions
to associate it with a GraphQL field. For this, AppSync Butler offers a simple development framework to parse and load VTL resolvers into CDK or SST AppSync constructs by leveraging an intuitive directory structure.  

## ðŸš€Â  Features
âœ¨Â  Simple and intuitive. AppSync Butler is an open and humble framework.   
   
ðŸ’‰Â  Variable injection. Define global variables for replacement in AppSync mapping templates.

ðŸ¦„Â  Bind resolvers to data sources from within request mapping templates.  
  
ðŸ¥žÂ  Comaptible with AWS **Cloud Development Kit** and **Serverless Stack Toolkit**.  

## ðŸ¤”Â  How it works
:::tip

If you're unfamiliar with AWS AppSync, head over to the [AWS AppSync Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/what-is-appsync.html).

:::
With the below GraphQL schema and directory structure, AppSync Butler maps each AppSync Resolver to its corresponding GraphQL field.
<Row>
<div className="col col--6">

```graphql
schema {
    query: Query
    mutation: Mutation
}

type Query {
    getPost(id: ID!): Post
}

type Mutation {
    addPost(post: PostInput!): Post!
}

type Post {
    id: ID!
    author: Author!
    title: String!
    content: String!
}

type Author {
    id: ID!
    username: String!
}
```

</div>
<div className="col col--6">

```tree
vtl
â”œâ”€â”€ functions
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ GetAuthorByAuthorId
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ description.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ request.vtl
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ response.vtl

    â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ after.vtl
    â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ before.vtl
    â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ pipeline.seq
    â””â”€â”€ Query
        â””â”€â”€ getPost
            â”œâ”€â”€ request.vtl
            â””â”€â”€ response.vtl
```

</Row>

### âœ¨Â  Tabular representation

Resolver                        | Resolver Type | GraphQL Type | GraphQL Field
--------------------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------
vtl/resolvers/Query/getPost     | Unit          | Query        | getPost
vtl/resolvers/Mutation/addPost  | Unit          | Mutation     | addPost
vtl/resolvers/Post/author       | Pipeline      | Post         | author

### ðŸ¤–Â  Functions
Each subdirectory under `vtl/functions/` should contain the necessary files to build an AppSync VTL function:
- Request Mapping Template: `request.vtl` 
- Response Mapping Template: `response.vtl`
- Description (optional): `description.txt`

When loading functions, AppSync Butler iterates over each function and adds it to the supplied CDK or SST AppSync construct.

### ðŸ§ Â  Resolvers
:::info

AppSync Butler supports both **unit** and **pipeline** resolvers.

:::
Each subdirectory under `vtl/resolvers/` should represent a valid GraphQL type (e.g. `vtl/resolvers/Query`) and contains zero-or-more subdirectories as field-level resolvers (e.g. `vtl/resolver/Query/getPost`). AppSync Butler reads the VTL files in `vtl/resolver/Query/getPost` and adds the `Query.getPost` resolver to the GraphQL API construct.    

#### Unit resolver files
- Request Mapping Template: `request.vtl`
- Response Mapping Template: `response.vtl`

#### Pipeline resolver files
- Before Mapping Template (optional): `before.vtl`
- Pipeline sequence definition file: `pipeline.seq`
- After Mapping Template (optional): `after.vtl` 
 
The pipeline sequence defintion file denotes the ordered AppSync VTL functions to execute sequentially using newline-delimitted function names. To execute `vtl/functions/GetUserId` and `vtl/functions/GetUser`, we can define the pipeline sequence defintion file in the following format:
```
GetUserId
GetUser
```
AppSync Butler handles the necessary steps to load this pipeline resolver into AppSync.

### áµ¡Â  Variables
AppSync Butler parses mapping templates (request, response, before, after) and
replaces references of a user-defined variable to its specified value.
Variables are denoted as `{{ var }}`. Variables are defined during the
[instantialization of a loader](/docs/api/#createloader) or set using
[`loader.builder.parser.setVariable(key, value)`](/docs/api/classes/Parser#setvariable)

:::danger

AppSync Butler throws an [`UndefinedVariableError`](/docs/api/classes/UndefinedVariableError) if an unrecognized
variable is encountered in a mapping template.

:::

### ðŸ”®Â  Data Sources
Data sources are provided during instantialization and specified directly from
with-in request mapping templates.
```json title="/vtl/resolvers/Query/getPost/request.vtl" {1}
##@butler.dataSource('myDynamoDbDataSource')

{
    "version": "...",
    "operation": "GetItem",
    "key": { ... }
}
```
:::info

Alternatively, the default data source can be provided during instantialization.
This is highly suitable for Single Table design applications where setting the
data source is not necessary.

:::

## ðŸŽ¯Â  Who's this for
- Developers utilizing AWS CDK or SST to deploy a GraphQL API.
- Entrepreneurs leveraging AWS AppSync to define their business logic
and require a simplistic AppSync development framework with a
smooth learning curve.

:::tip

As an entrepreneur that is heavily relying on AWS AppSync, it is highly cruicial
to employ Infrastructure-as-Code tools such as AWS Cloud Development Kit or Serverless
Stack Toolkit to define your stack as it boosts your product value.

## ðŸš˜Â  Forthcoming features
To support us, give this project a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/alichry/aws-appsync-butler). Here's a list of future objectives that are still under consideration:
- Provide a, programmable, resolver testing mechanism through deploying a test stack and executing GraphQL
operations against it. Alternatively, simulating VTL templates yields a zero-cost test suite.
- VTL validation prior deployment. This would cut-down time spent in errorus deployments.
- Access properties of other data sources (e.g. a DynamoDB's table name) instead of relying
on defined variables.
- Possibly warn users of any missing resolvers for any GraphQL fields.
