Can you improve the docs? [Please submit a PR!](https://github.com/alichry/aws-appsync-butler)

## What's next?

- [Define a variable](/docs/api/classes/Parser#setvariable) in your AppSync Mapping Template.
- Tweet about your experience with AWS AppSync Butler.
- Looking to contribute? Let's discuss more on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/aws-appsync-butler/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) to get started.
